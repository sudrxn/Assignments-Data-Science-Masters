    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical concepts used in \n",
    "probability theory and statistics to describe the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Mass Function (PMF):**\n",
    "   - The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a finite or countably infinite set\n",
    "    of distinct values.\n",
    "   - It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to a particular value.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, for a discrete random variable X, the PMF is denoted as P(X = x), where x is a\n",
    "    specific value that X can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   Consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of a single roll. The PMF\n",
    "    for X is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[ P(X = 1) = P(X = 2) = P(X = 3) = P(X = 4) = P(X = 5) = P(X = 6) = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the PMF assigns equal probabilities (1/6) to each possible outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n",
    "   - The PDF is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a range.\n",
    "   - Instead of giving the probability at a specific point, the PDF provides the probability density over\n",
    "a range of values.\n",
    "   - The probability of a continuous random variable falling within a specific interval is given by the\n",
    "    area under the PDF curve over that interval.\n",

    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   Let's consider a continuous random variable Y representing the height of individuals in a population. \n",

    "A Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a mathematical function that describes the probability that a random \n",
    "variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given point. In other words, it gives the cumulative\n",
    "probability distribution of a random variable. The CDF is often denoted by the letter F and is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ F(x) = P(X \\leq x) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \\(X\\) is the random variable, and \\(F(x)\\) represents the probability that \\(X\\) takes a value less \n",
    "than or equal to \\(x\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF provides a way to understand the distribution of a random variable and is particularly useful in\n",
    "probability and statistics. It has several important properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-decreasing:** The CDF is a non-decreasing function, meaning that as the value of \\(x\\) increases,\n",
    "the probability \\(P(X \\leq x)\\) does not decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limits:** The limit of the CDF as \\(x\\) approaches negative infinity is 0, and as \\(x\\) approaches \n",
    "positive infinity, the limit is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Right-Continuity:** The CDF is a right-continuous function, meaning that it has no jumps; the\n",
    "probability at a specific point is the limit from the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the concept of CDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a six-sided die. Let \\(X\\) be the random variable representing the outcome of a single \n",

    "\\[ F(x) = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^{x} i \\]\n",

    "number less than or equal to \\(x\\) on a single die roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you want to find the probability of getting a 4 or less, you would evaluate \\(F(4)\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ F(4) = \\frac{1}{6} \\sum_{i=1}^{4} i = \\frac{1}{6} \\times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = \\frac{10}{36} \\]\n",

    "Certainly! Here's a conversational summary of the Central Limit Theorem in bullet points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal-Like Averages:**\n",
    "  - When you're studying a population (like people's heights in a town), the Central Limit Theorem says \n",
    "    that if you grab decent-sized groups and find their average, those averages will behave like a bell\n",
    "    curve, no matter how crazy the individual heights are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling the Mystery:**\n",
    "  - Even if you don't know the exact pattern of the heights in the town\n",
    "    (some super tall, some really short), the magic of the CLT kicks in when your groups are big enough.\n",
    "    It lets you make reasonable guesses about the overall average height.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Practical Use in Everyday Stuff:**\n",
    "  - This isn't just for heights; it's a tool for all kinds of predictions. Whether it's guessing election \n",
    "    results from polls, figuring out the average income in a city, or making sure products meet quality\n",
    "    standards in manufacturing, the CLT helps us make sense of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bigger Samples, Better Predictions:**\n",
    "  - The more people you include in your groups (samples), the closer your average heights or whatever\n",
    "    you're measuring get to a nice, predictable bell curve. So, researchers often aim for big samples\n",
    "    to get a clearer picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Normal Is Handy:**\n",
    "  - Even if your original data doesn't look perfectly normal, many statistical tools like normal \n",
    "    distributions. The CLT says, \"Don't worry if your data is a bit quirky. With a big enough sample,\n",
    "    you can treat it like it's normal, and things will work out pretty well.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the Central Limit Theorem is like statistical magic that lets us make sense of things \n",
