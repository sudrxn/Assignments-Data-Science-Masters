    "1. **Variance Components:**\n",
    "   - ANOVA breaks down total variance into different components.\n",
    "   - Total variance = Variance within groups + Variance between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Within-Group Variance:**\n",
    "   - Measures variability within each group.\n",
    "   - Represents random variation or error.\n",

    "   - **Mean Imputation:** Replace missing values with the mean of observed values for that variable.\n",
    "   - **Interpolation:** Estimate missing values based on the observed data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Potential Consequences:**\n",
    "   - **Pairwise Deletion:** Can lead to biased results and loss of power, especially if missing data are\n",
    "    not random.\n",
    "   - **Mean Imputation:** May distort variance and relationships, assuming missing values are missing\n",
    "completely at random (MCAR).\n",
    "   - **Interpolation:** Assumes a specific pattern of change between observed data points, potentially\n",
    "    introducing bias if the pattern is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the appropriate method depends on the nature and extent of missing data, and the assumptions you\n",

    "1. **Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD):**\n",

    "   - **Use:** To control for family-wise error rate by adjusting significance levels for multiple \n",

    "   - **Example:** When you have multiple pairwise comparisons to make, like comparing the means of \n",
