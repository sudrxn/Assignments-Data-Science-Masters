    "ans: A class in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template that specifies the properties and characteristics\n",
    "     of a particular kind of object. On the other hand, an object is an instance of a class with its own particular set of values\n",
    "      for the class's defined attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Let's use the class \"Car\" as an example.\n",
    "      All automobiles have some characteristics, including the make, model, and year, as well as specific actions, like accelerating,\n",
    "      braking, and turning. These characteristics and actions would be defined by the \"Car\" class. \n",

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: Object-Oriented Programming's (OOPs) four pillars are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1) Encapsulation: This is the process of combining data and the methods (functions) that work on it into a single entity,\n",
    "     like a class. Encapsulation makes a programme more modular and easier to maintain by allowing data to be hidden from other\n",
    "     programme components and accessed only through a specific interface.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  2)Abstraction: This involves identifying the essential characteristics of an object or system and ignoring all others.\n",
    "    Abstraction allows complex systems to be broken down into simpler parts, which can be independently designed and implemented.\n",
    "    It also allows the implementation of an object to be modified without affecting its external behavior.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  3)Inheritance: This is a mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and behaviors of another class.\n",
    "    Inheritance allows new  classes to be built on top of existing ones, reducing redundancy and improving code reuse.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  4)Polymorphism, which translates as \"many forms,\" describes an object's capacity to adopt a variety of distinct shapes \n",
    "    depending on the situation in which it is used. Method calling and method overloading, which enable various objects to \n",
    "    respond differently to the same message or method call, are frequently used to create polymorphism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: When a class instance is created in Python, the __init__() function is a unique method that is called. \n",
    "     This function is used to set up any additional setup requirements as well as initialise the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The initial state of an object is frequently defined using the __init__() function. If you have a Vehicle class,\n",
    "        for instance, you could use the __init__() method to establish the make, model, and year attributes' initial values.\n",

    "\n",
    "ans: \"Self\" is a term used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to denote the instance of the class that is presently being worked\n",
    "     on. The term \"Self\" refers to the object to which the method or attribute is a part.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every element in OOP is an object with its own set of characteristics and methods. A function or attribute can refer to the \n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Let's use the class \"Person\" as an example. It has a function called \"greet.\" We can use the \"greet\" function to interact \n",

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: A key idea in object-oriented programming (OOP) is inheritance, which enables a class to take on traits and functions \n",
    "    from other classes. The class being inherited from is known as the superclass or base class, while the class being inherited\n",
    "    from is known as the subclass or derived class. The ability to create complex class hierarchies is made possible via inheritance,\n",
    "    which promotes code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #Four types of inheritance exist:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1) Single inheritance: In single inheritance, a subclass inherits from a single superclass. The subclass inherits all the\n",
