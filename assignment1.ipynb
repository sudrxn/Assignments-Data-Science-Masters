    "   Q1: Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ans:  The choice between using a for loop and a while loop depends on the specific requirements of the task that you're trying to accomplish.\n",
    "        Here's an example of when to use a for loop:\n",
    "        Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to print each number in the list. Here's how you could use a for loop to accomplish this:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "        for num in numbers:\n",
    "            print(num)\n",
    " \n",
    "   \n",
    "       \n",
    "    \n",
    "        In this example, the for loop will iterate over each number in the list, and the block of code inside the loop will be executed once for each iteration.\n",
    "        The variable num will take on the value of each element in the list, one at a time.\n",
    "        \n",

    "        Here's an example of when to use a while loop: Suppose you want to print the numbers from 1 to 5.\n",

    "            num += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "         In this example, the while loop will continue to execute as long as the condition num <= 5 is true.\n",
    "        The code inside the loop will increase the value of num by 1 on each iteration, \n",
    "        so eventually the condition will become false and the loop will terminate\n",
