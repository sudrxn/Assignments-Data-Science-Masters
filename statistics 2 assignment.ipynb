    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, provide insights into the spread \n",

    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference \n",
    "    between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It gives a rough idea of how spread out the values in a dataset are.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   Suppose you have a dataset of exam scores for a class of students: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90. The range would\n",
    "    be (90 - 70 = 20), indicating that the scores vary by 20 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. It measures how far \n",
    "    each data point in the set is from the mean.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It provides a more comprehensive view of the spread, but the squared differences can be\n",
    "     difficult to interpret on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of\n",
    "    the average distance between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "   - **Use:** It is more interpretable than the variance because it is in the same units as the original \n",
