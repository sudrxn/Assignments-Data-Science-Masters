    "\n",
    "**Measures of Central Tendency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean:**\n",
    "   - The mean, or average, is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the\n",
    "    number of values.\n",
    "   - Formula: \\( \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of values}}{\\text{Number of values}} \\)\n",
    "   - The mean provides a measure of the \"center\" of the data and is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median:**\n",
    "   - The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest.\n",
    "   - If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "   - The median is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean and is a measure of central tendency that\n",
    "    works well with skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode:**\n",
    "   - The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "   - A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode at all.\n",
    "   - The mode is useful for categorical data and can be used for numerical data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of Variability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:**\n",
    "   - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "   - It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data but is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance:**\n",
    "   - Variance measures how far each data point in the set is from the mean.\n",
    "   - A higher variance indicates greater variability, while a lower variance suggests that the values are \n",
    "closer to the mean.\n",
    "   - Formula: \\( \\text{Variance} = \\frac{\\sum{(X_i - \\text{Mean})^2}}{n} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "   - It provides a measure of the average distance between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "   - A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, while a larger\n",
    "    standard deviation indicates greater variability.\n",
    "   - Formula: \\( \\text{Standard Deviation} = \\sqrt{\\text{Variance}} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interquartile Range (IQR):**\n",
    "   - IQR is the range of values between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) in a dataset.\n",
    "   - It is less sensitive to extreme values than the range and provides a measure of variability in the central portion of the data.\n",
