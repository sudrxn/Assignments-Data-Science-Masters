    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are designing a game that involves various types of characters, such as heroes, villains, and non-playable\n",

    "Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",

    "To create an abstract class for the car, you can define only the essential properties and methods required to operate a car. \n",

    "The implementation details of how the car's engine works or how the wheels turn are not necessary to be exposed to the user \n",

    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "To encapsulate the car's properties and methods, you can make the properties private, so that they cannot be accessed directly\n",
    "from outside the class. You can provide public methods such as 'getSpeed' and 'setSpeed' that can access the private speed \n",
    "property and modify it based on the user's input. This way, you can prevent unauthorized access to the car's internal data and\n",
